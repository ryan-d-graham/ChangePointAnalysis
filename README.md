# ChangePointAnalysis

## Overview
This repository focuses on change point detection and rate-monitoring for time-tagged event data using Bayesian Blocks (Scargle, 2013). By leveraging advanced statistical methods, this repository offers efficient and accurate change point detection mechanisms.

## Introduction
Change point analysis involves identifying points in time where the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. This repository contains several scripts that showcase different approaches to detecting change points using Python.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Installation
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryan-d-graham/ChangePointAnalysis.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ChangePointAnalysis

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects

### BayesRate.py
This script utilizes Bayesian methods to detect change points in time series data. By applying probabilistic models, it identifies the most probable locations of structural breaks. Note: Currently, BayesRate.py does not take command line arguments and needs to be configured within the script itself.

### GoldSpeed.py
Implements a method to detect changes in the rate of events, providing a detailed analysis of temporal event sequences. This script also needs to be configured within the script itself for input and output paths.

## Usage

### Running BayesRate.py
To detect change points using the Bayesian method, configure the script parameters within the script itself, then run it using Python.

### Running GoldSpeed.py
To detect changes in event rates using GoldSpeed, configure the script parameters within the script itself, then run it using Python.

### Example Output
The scripts output the detected change points to the terminal and visualize results using Matplotlib.

## Further Reading
For a detailed understanding of the Bayesian Blocks method and its applications, refer to:
- **Scargle, J.D. (2013)**. "Bayesian Blocks for Time Series Analysis". *Astrophysical Journal*. [IOPScience](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/764/2/167).

### Note on p0
The parameter p0 controls the prior probability of a change point occurring.

- **Increasing p0**: Raises the likelihood of detecting more change points, which can lead to overfitting in noisy data.
- **Decreasing p0**: Results in fewer detected change points, providing a more conservative model that may underfit if the data contains numerous genuine changes.

**Tuning p0**: Adjust p0 based on the specific application and the expected frequency of change points. For datasets with frequent changes, a higher p0 might be appropriate, while for more stable datasets, a lower p0 may prevent overfitting.
