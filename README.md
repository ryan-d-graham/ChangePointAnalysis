This is a little script I wrote to apply the research in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5578 to track changepoints in and levels of customer queue intensity in real time at Golden Chick. 

Other use cases include:

1) Detecting abrupt changes in radiation intensity with particle detections logged as TTE data (astronomy was its initial purpose)
2) Detecting times at which abrupt changes in churn rate occur and the churn rates within these time blocks
3) ... rates at which customers place meal orders... (my application for work) ... to predict employee workload
4) ... call rates for a business ... when to place the most effort on answering calls with limited time
5) ... traffic flow ...
